# TerminalX changelog

## 0.2.0

TerminalX gets a phone, a command palette, automations, and an honest view
of what the agents are costing you.

### Companion app and accounts

- Optional TerminalX account sign-in from the sidebar or Settings → Account.
  Sign-in goes through the deployed console with PKCE and returns on
  `terminalx://auth/callback`; credentials live in the Keychain and every
  local workflow keeps working without an account.
- Pair a phone in Settings → Devices, over the relay or entirely on the LAN.
  Pairing is end-to-end encrypted and bound to this Mac's identity; unclaimed
  invites expire and superseded credentials are discarded.
- The companion sees this Mac's sessions and tabs, follows the transcript and
  terminal live, posts notes, promotes a note into a prompt, answers
  permission requests, and sends write-gated terminal input. The Mac stays the
  only copy of the session; the phone keeps a bounded cache and nothing is
  stored in the cloud. ([docs/MOBILE.md](docs/MOBILE.md),
  [docs/ACCOUNTS.md](docs/ACCOUNTS.md))
- Attachments travel with the message on both desktop and phone, and survive
  a failed send.

### Automations

- An Automations workspace: define an automation, run it from a GitHub
  issue, and watch each run land in its own worktree and session. Runs are
  persisted and listed in a full-screen table — trigger, status, timing,
  worktree, result or pull request.

### Navigation

- A global command palette (⌘K) for jumping to a session, opening a file,
  running an app command, or typing a task or workspace name straight in;
  it hands focus back to wherever you were.
- One sidebar for getting around: projects, workspaces, sessions, agent
  tabs and shell tabs sit in a single expandable tree, and Files is the one
  file browser. The separate workspace column and the ⌘⇧E explorer pane are
  gone; keyboard navigation, workspace provenance and terminal lifetimes are
  unchanged.
- Shell terminals are now tabs inside the session, alongside agent tabs,
  instead of a dock at the bottom. Terminal scrollback is retained within a
  bound so a freshly attached companion can replay recent output.
- Stats and Usage (⌘⇧U): a full-area view of local analytics — which
  agents ran, for how long, and what they used — plus Codex credit
  balances and reset times. Everything is computed on this Mac from its own
  transcripts.
- Agent icons are recognizable and accessible in every picker and tab.

### Workspaces and sessions

- Workspaces can be renamed.
- Delete is offered for clean, merged workspaces; sessions refresh after a
  worktree is removed and a deleted workspace's session provenance is kept.
- Projects stay focused when clicked, and the file tree no longer shows the
  previous project's files after a switch.
- New sessions default to the bypass permission mode.
- Codex tabs replay a fresh rollout after the session starts and no longer
  echo image prompts twice.

### Dictation

- The microphone and speech permission prompts are deferred until the first
  time dictation actually starts; opening the composer or Settings no longer
  touches either.

### Identity

- The app now ships as TerminalX while retaining the `com.terminalx.next`
  bundle identifier. It registers `terminalx://` and still recognizes
  `terminalx-next://` links in code for compatibility. Development builds use
  the separate TerminalX Dev identity and the existing "D" badge; the release
  keeps its badged icon too. The command-line tool and first-party skill now
  install as `terminalx` and `terminalx-cli`; `tnx` remains an alias.
- Claude tabs now run the real interactive CLI in a terminal, and the chat is a
  view of that one process: the transcript is read from the CLI's own session
  file, status and permission cards come from its hooks, and ⌘⇧T flips between
  chat and terminal without stopping anything or waiting for a turn to end.
  ([docs/PTY-FIRST.md](docs/PTY-FIRST.md))
- Codex tabs work the same way: the real `codex` TUI in the tab, its rollout
  read into the chat, and its hooks — installed in a Codex home TerminalX
  manages so your own `~/.codex` is never edited — carrying status and approvals, with
  "Ask every time" now asking about every tool rather than only the ones Codex
  would have stopped for.
- Claude Code and Codex are the agents TerminalX offers; Cursor and
  OpenCode are no longer listed in the pickers or in Settings → Agents.
  Sessions and tabs already running on them open and work exactly as before.

## 0.1.0

First runnable build, assembled checkpoint by checkpoint.

- Sessions are git worktrees; each session holds tabs, and each tab is an agent conversation.
- Claude Code over stream-json, Codex over its app-server, Cursor over ACP, OpenCode over its local server.
- Streaming transcript with tool calls, diffs, permission cards and question cards; follow pin that never hides the composer.
- Composer with `@` file mentions, `/` slash commands, image drop and paste, queued follow-ups while a turn runs.
- Right panel: changes for the last turn or the whole session, repository status and history, pull requests through the GitHub CLI, and a file tree.
- Terminal dock (⌘J) with shells in the session's checkout that survive switching sessions.
- Editor tabs with a gutter against HEAD, save, and a banner when the file changes on disk; ⌘P quick open and ⌘⇧F project search.
- Notifications graded by attention: desktop banner, in-app notice, or just the tone; dock badge.
- A pixel raccoon that potters about an empty session and runs along the composer while an agent works.
- Worktree lifecycle: settle after a merge, fork a session, guarded delete.
- Themes (den, slate, moss, ember) with light and dark modes and window vibrancy.
- Terminal view for any agent tab (⌘⇧T): the same conversation in the agent's own CLI, and back again with the transcript caught up.
- Dictation from either composer — the new-session box and the one inside a session (⌘⇧D) — using the Mac's own on-device speech recognition; nothing is downloaded and audio never leaves the machine.
- Optional local transcription models (Parakeet, Nemotron, Canary, Whisper) downloaded on demand in Settings → Transcription, plus a microphone picker and mute-while-recording.
- File explorer beside the transcript (⌘⇧E) with Material file icons, git status badges, keyboard navigation and a right-click menu.
- Issues from GitHub and Linear (⌘I): browse, read, and start a session on one; the worktree is named after the issue and the header links back to it.
- Files open in an editor pane beside the chat with their own tabs; markdown renders as a preview with a Source toggle.
- Projects rail with mascots, colours and logos; workspaces (every checkout, including worktrees made outside the app) listed with their sessions; workspace delete guarded by pushed state and pull-request status.
- Agent dashboard (⌘⇧A): every session across every project in three columns — needs you, working, done — with the last thing said on each card, search, filters and keyboard navigation.
- Codex offers the models your account can actually run, read from the CLI itself rather than hard-coded; a session still on a retired model is moved to the current one and told so.
